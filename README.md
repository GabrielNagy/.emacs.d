# .emacs.d [![Build Status](https://github.com/GabrielNagy/.emacs.d/workflows/Startup/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GabrielNagy/.emacs.d/actions?workflow=Startup)

...or how to configure an editor in 1,5k LOC

Should work on versions 26 and up, not interested in supporting previous releases as I'm not using them.

## Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/GabrielNagy/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
```

Works fine on Linux/macOS, YMMV on Windows.
